#' Virginia School of Medicine diabetes dataset 
#' 
#' The data consist of 17 variables on 373 subjects from 1046 subjects who were interviewed in a study to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors in central Virginia for African Americans. According to Dr John Hong, Diabetes Mellitus Type II (adult onset diabetes) is associated most strongly with obesity. The waist/hip ratio may be a predictor in diabetes and heart disease. DM II is also agssociated with hypertension - they may both be part of "Syndrome X". The 373 subjects were the ones who were actually screened for diabetes, minus subjects with missing values in the original dataset. Glycosolated hemoglobin > 7.0 is usually taken as a positive diagnosis of diabetes.
